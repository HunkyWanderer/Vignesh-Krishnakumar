# Hi there 👋, I'm Vignesh Krishnakumar

Curious, quantitative problem-solver working across **data analysis**, **reporting**, and **enterprise IT**. Enjoys turning messy operational data into clear insights, tools, and documentation that teams can actually use.

- 🔭 Comfortable working end-to-end: from understanding a question → cleaning/structuring data → visualisation → documentation → sharing results with non-technical stakeholders
- 💼 Experience spans education metrics, health audit data, service operations, aviation analytics, and infrastructure projects (PKI, access management, SharePoint workspaces)
- ✨ Interested in roles/projects where data, processes, and people intersect: better reporting, better decisions, smoother operations
